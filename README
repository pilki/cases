The archive has 3 subdirectories:
src/ contains the code of the plugin in case_tactics.ml and
  a support file for building the case_tactics plugin.

theories/ contains support Coq file for the plugin.
  Case_Tactics.v declares the plugin on the Coq side.

test-suite/ just demonstrates a use of the plugin


Installation
============

First, you should have coqc, ocamlc and make in your path. 
Then simply do:

# coq_makefile -f Make -o Makefile

To generate a makefile from the description in Make, then [make].
This will consecutively build the plugin, the supporting 
theories and the test-suite file.

You can then either [make install] the plugin or leave it in its
current directory. To be able to import it from anywhere in Coq,
simply add the following to ~/.coqrc:

Add Rec LoadPath "path_to_case_tactics/theories" as Case_Tactics.
Add ML Path "path_to_case_tactics/src".
